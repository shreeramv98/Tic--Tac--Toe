# Tic--Tac--Toe
The final project for the Course on SCILAB.

The traditional two-player game of tic tac toe, commonly referred to as noughts and crosses, is frequently played on a 3x3 grid. The aim of the game is to be the first person to arrange three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a line on the grid that is either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

Tic-Tac-Toe is commonly played as follows:

Equipment:

Players will set their symbols in a 3x3 grid with nine cells.
There are two players, and they often alternate using "X" and "O."

Rules:

A 3x3 grid is blank at the start of the game.
The "X" or "O" sign is placed in one of the open cells by each player in turn.

The game is won by the first person to line up three of their symbols side by side or diagonally.

A draw (sometimes referred to as a "cat's game") occurs when all the cells on the grid are filled but no player has managed to make a winning combination.

Successful Combinations:

There are eight different ways to win in tic tac toe:



The top, middle, and bottom horizontal rows are arranged in three rows.

There are three vertical columns: the left, center, and right columns.

There are two diagonals: the top-right diagonal runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner, and vice versa.

Gameplay:

It is turn-based, with the first player placing their symbol in an empty cell, followed by the other player doing the same.
The game goes on until one player has a winning combination or the grid is completely filled.
A player is deemed the winner and the game is over if they are successful in creating a winning combination.
The game is deemed a tie if all cells are filled up with no winners.

Despite being a straightforward game, tic tac toe has a strategy. In addition to trying to make a winning combination, a competent player will want to prevent their rival from doing the same. A draw will always result if neither player commits an error.
